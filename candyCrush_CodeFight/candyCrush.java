   *There are N children who came up with a new game. 
   * They all seat around a circular table and each of them has 1 candy. 
   * The rule of the game is that the first child passes 1 candy to the second child, 
   * then the second child passes 2 candies to the third child. 
   * The third child then passes 1 candy to the fourth and so on 
   * (i.e. each of them passes 1 or 2 candies alternately). 
   * Every time a child has no candies left, he/she gets eliminated. 
   * The child who gets all the candies wins the game. 
   * Given an integer N, return true if the game will ever end. 
   * The game ends if there is only one child left. Otherwise, return false.
